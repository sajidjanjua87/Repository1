This website is an ongoing project of the web-development course assignments. 
I will keep modifying it through out the course.

Initial Development:
The header of the website welcomes the user along with the prompts which greet the user and ask for their name.
The website will keep prompting untill the user gives an input.
Also the user is asked 5 yes/no questions.
After the question, a final greeting is displayed.
The webpage gives the short biography about myself and the summary of the questions and their answers.

Update lab 3:
Two new questions have been added in the prompt.
First question asks the user to guess a number between 1 and 10 and gives the user 4 chances.
Second question asks the user to guess a number out of multiple possible numbers between 1 and 50 and gives the user 6 chances.
If the user fails to guess them, the numbers are displayed to the user.
On the webpage, education summary has been added.
Also antoher new section has been added, which shows Top 10 visiting places around the world.
